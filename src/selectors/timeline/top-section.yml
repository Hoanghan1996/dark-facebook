  info: |

    for a page,
    contains the page name,
    brief information,
    the like button,
    and other links.
  selector: ".fbTimelineTopSection"
  children:
    base:
      selector: ".fbTimelineTopSectionBase"
    bottom-border:
      info: |
        At the very bottom of the top section of the timeline,
        there is a curved border image at the bottom.
        Thus, we need to eliminate it.
      selector: ".topSectionBottomBorder"
    frame:
      info: |
        Those rectangle links in the timeline.
      selector: ".fbTimelineNavigationWrapper .frame"
      children:
        inner:
          selector: "& .mat"
        detail:
          selector: ".fbTimelineNavigationWrapper .detail"
          info: |
            We need a separate detail selector
            because that's where the background gets applied.
            
            If we just apply the background to the frame,
            some pictures will go missing.
