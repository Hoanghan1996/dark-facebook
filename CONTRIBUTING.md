Hacking on dark-facebook 2
--------------------------
* Make sure you understand how [dark-facebook 2 theming process works](docs/theming-process.md).
* __Do not__ put facebook-specific selectors in LESS files.
  Put them in selector definition files.
* Make sure that you documented each selector you added.
  * If possible and appropriate,
    add a picture of the component you added to the `docs/images/components` folder.
* Commit message should include the name of the component changes in square brackets (the git hook provided already helps you do it).
